v1.2.1 (20 Feb 2014)
  Added a check to ensure that a callback is passed when the "include" option
    is enabled.

v1.2.0 (07 Feb 2014)
  The sections now can contain a namespace chain, that is, dot-separated
    sections can be split up like dot-separated properties.
  Fixed variable expansion when the "namespace" option is enabled.
  Minor improvements.

v1.1.3 (07 Dec 2013)
  When a namespace chain is invalid it now returns an error.

v1.1.2 (22 Oct 2013)
  Bugfix stringifying characters when "unicode" was true (improved ISO 8859-1
    compatibility).

v1.1.1 (14 Oct 2013)
  Bugfix when "parse()" was called with only 1 parameter.

v1.1.0 (12 Oct 2013)
  Removed "json" parsing option (improved parsing speed).
  Removed "Stringifier.from()".
  Removed optional parameter from "stringifier()".
  Renamed "stringifier()" to "createStringifier()".

v1.0.4 (07 Sep 2013)
  When "namespaces" are in use the objects are merged correctly.
  When "path" is used the callback is called correctly.

v1.0.3 (16 Aug 2013)
  The paths from the imported files are relative to the current file.

v1.0.2 (16 Aug 2013)
  Minor bugfixes with sections that don't end with "]".

v1.0.1 (11 Aug 2013)
  Some bugfixes including files.

v1.0.0 (08 Aug 2013)
  Complete refactor from scratch.
  Improved reading speed by ~45%. This new version iterates the data only once
    while the previous version was a direct port from the Java source code and
    was iterating four times over the same data.
  Improved writing speed by ~77%.
  All the dependencies have been removed.
  If the sections are enabled the properties should be stringified using a
    Stringifier instead of giving a raw object.
  "load()" and "store" have been removed and "parse()" and "stringify()" can
    read and write from/to files with the "path" option.
  Added "json" option to "parse()". When it is enabled stringified json arrays
    and objects are parsed into javascript arrays and objects.
  Added "namespaces" option to "parse()". When it is enabled the dots in the
    keys will be interpreted as namespaces.
  Added "vars" option to "parse()". When the variables are enabled and a
    variable does not exist it first looks into the "vars" object before
    throwing an error. It can be used to pass environment variables.
  Added "strict" option to "parse()". When it is enabled the parser will only
    consider as coments and separators the tokens included in the "comments"
    and "separators" options.
  Added "include" option to "parse()". The "include" key can be used to import
    other files.
  Removed "bufferSize" and "encoding" options. Files are read using a 16KB
    buffer size and utf8 encoding.
  Removed the "pretty" option from "stringify()". The required code to
    accomplish the column limit is too complex and the feature is rarely used.
    This option contains bugs in the previous versions. The overall stringify
    speed is faster.
  The stringify replacer must be a function. Cannot be an array like in previous
    versions.
  Some bugfixes with escaped backslashes.
  Some bugfixes with whitespace values.
  Some bugfixes with sections.
  Some bugfixes with "stringify()".

    itself.
